# Pokemon Battle Simulation

This is a text-based (runs in the terminal) game against "AI" Sinnoh champion Cynthia

Run main() and everything else should be self-explanatory

It is intentionally difficult to win...

My AI is relatively simple in that it just chooses whichever move does the most damage

The beauty of my code I think is that it is very complex and open to expansion. 
I had to import the pokemon and move data by hand so I didn't include everything in a game.
I do however have the framework for the basic battle mechanics (status conditions, stat modifiers, accuracy checks, speed order, etc)
It's possible you will encounter some of these as you battle.
Please know that it was relatively difficult to implement all these edge case things.

I hope you like my program (and lose a lot)
